# SECURITY.md — Issue 1 trust-boundary sweep

Loop: `sweep-triage-fix-resweep`. Scope: `code/apps/storage/src`,
`code/apps/realtime/src`, `infra/`. Secrets: full git history (`git log -p`).

Phase: **FIX (partial)** — sweep complete (a second pass adds no rows).
Maintainer verdict (2026-07-04): **self-host-only posture** — the managed-mode
cross-tenant rows (1–4, 8, 9) are resolved by *documenting and gating* the
trust boundary, not by building tenant ACLs. That work is done on the
`security/managed-mode-trust-boundary` branch. Rows **5, 6, 7** are
mode-independent (they harden even a single-tenant self-host that faces the
internet) and are **still open pending a separate verdict** — they were not in
scope of the "document + gate" decision.

Done when every finding at or above the agreed floor reads clean on re-audit
AND a fresh full sweep of both directories adds no rows.

Fix rule: one finding per commit, message references its row; re-audit each.

| # | finding | file | severity | user trust broken | fix commit | re-audit |
|---|---------|------|----------|-------------------|------------|----------|
| 1 | `GET /maps/:id` and `PUT /maps/:id` never compare the map's stored `workspace_id` to the caller's workspace — `client.getMap(id)`/`updateMap(id)` take only the id | `routes/maps.ts:47-85`; adapters `sqlite-fs.ts`/`postgres-minio.ts` `getMap` ignore workspace | **HIGH** | Cross-tenant read + overwrite: in managed mode any caller with any valid `X-Workspace-ID` reads or clobbers any map by knowing its 21-char id | documented+gated (`security/managed-mode-trust-boundary` branch): honest SECURITY comment at site + boot warning + trust-boundary doc. ACL not built (maintainer decision: self-host-only posture) | doc + comment present; managed mode defaults off and warns loudly at boot |
| 2 | `POST /maps/:id/share` mints a 7-day public read token for **any** map id with no ownership check (`getMap` presence check only) | `routes/share.ts:38-77` | **HIGH** | Cross-tenant exfiltration: a tenant mints a public share link for another tenant's map, then reads it (and its blob) unauthenticated via `/share/:token` | documented+gated (same branch): honest SECURITY comment at the mint site + trust-boundary doc | doc + comment present |
| 3 | `/yjs/:roomId` upgrade takes the whole path suffix verbatim as docName, no auth; data-layer + comments Y.Docs are **plaintext** (ADR-0010 Option C). The header's claimed "workspace ACL at the path-routing boundary" does not exist — Caddy has no `/yjs` route and the relay parses the path raw | `realtime/yjs-server.ts:104-115`; `infra/caddy/Caddyfile` (no `/yjs` route) | **HIGH** | Any client knowing a `roomId` connects to `/yjs/${roomId}` and reads/writes another room's plaintext GeoJSON data layers + comment text — the compensating SaaS ACL was never built | documented+gated (same branch): corrected the false "ACL exists" comment in `yjs-server.ts` to state the ACL does NOT exist + trust-boundary doc | doc + comment present |
| 4 | `GET /api/workspaces` returns every workspace row with no auth ("Phase 6 v1 has no user auth so this returns every row") | `routes/workspaces.ts:27-33` | **MED** | Full tenant enumeration in managed mode: workspace ids + plan tiers of all customers exposed to any managed-mode caller | documented+gated (same branch): honest SECURITY comment at the route + trust-boundary doc | doc + comment present |
| 5 | Socket.IO CORS `origin: "*"`, no auth on `JOIN_ROOM`; the `workspaceId` room-namespace is client-supplied and unvalidated | `realtime/index.ts:34`; `realtime/socket-io-server.ts:127-165` | **MED** | Room-slot exhaustion (DoS — `MAX_ROOM_SIZE` default 4) and ciphertext injection into any known room. Scene/comment payloads stay confidential (E2EE opaque blobs) so content isn't exposed — this is availability + integrity, not confidentiality | OPEN — mode-independent; pending maintainer verdict (see below) | |
| 6 | Relay published directly on host `4001:4001`, bypassing the Caddy/TLS front door; Caddyfile has no `/socket.io` or `/yjs` route | `infra/docker-compose.yml:113-114`; `infra/caddy/Caddyfile:16-22` | **MED** | Realtime traffic (cursors, camera, encrypted scene envelopes, **plaintext** Yjs data layers) rides unencrypted in transit in the documented full stack | OPEN — mode-independent; pending maintainer verdict (see below) | |
| 7 | No per-IP / per-client rate limiting on any storage HTTP route — only a 50 MiB body cap; realtime throttles sockets but storage throttles nothing | `storage/index.ts:53-56` (no rate-limit plugin); contrast `realtime/rate-limit.ts` | **MED** | Abuse / brute-force of the internet-facing storage API: unbounded `POST /maps`, share-token guessing attempts, blob-storage fill | OPEN — mode-independent; pending maintainer verdict (see below) | |
| 8 | `POST /api/billing/checkout` trusts `workspaceId` from the request body and never checks it matches the caller's `X-Workspace-ID` | `routes/billing.ts:168-207` | LOW | A tenant can open a Stripe checkout that credits/upgrades a different `workspaceId` (payment still required, so impact is limited) | documented (same branch): captured in trust-boundary doc as a managed-mode gap | doc present |
| 9 | Stripe webhook idempotency + replay protection is in-memory only — lost on restart, not shared across instances (acknowledged in-code) | `routes/billing.ts:63-98` | LOW | A webhook replayed during the restart window (or against another instance) reprocesses; single-instance v1 accepts this per the module docstring | documented (same branch): captured in trust-boundary doc as a managed-mode gap | doc present |

## Non-findings (verified clean during the sweep)

- **Stripe webhook signature verification** — present and correct: `constructEvent` on the raw buffer, 400 on missing/invalid sig (`billing.ts:218-243`). GAP-1 is closed.
- **Client-id validation** — `ID_RE` (`^[A-Za-z0-9_-]{21}$`) checked at every id/token entry point in `maps.ts`/`share.ts` and defensively again in both adapters. Share tokens are 21-char nanoids with expiry + orphan checks.
- **Git-history secret `4b07cca33ff2d2919bc95ff98f148e9e`** — upstream Excalidraw's public Firebase **web** `apiKey` (non-secret by design; enforcement is via Firebase security rules, not key secrecy). Already removed from the working tree in `2912fad`. Nothing to rotate. Other history hits (`tokentokentoken…`, `abcdefghij…`, `__PMTILES_PATH__`, `excalidraw-oai-api-key`) are test fixtures / placeholders.
- **Sentry `beforeSend`** scrubs Authorization headers and request IPs (`index.ts:36-45`).
- **Graceful shutdown** exists on storage (SIGTERM/SIGINT drain) — its *absence* on realtime is an operational finding tracked under ISSUES.md Issue 8, not a security row.

## Triage notes for the maintainer

The three HIGH rows (1, 2, 3) are all the same root shape: **managed/SaaS mode
ships tenant-isolation surface (`workspace_id` columns, `X-Workspace-ID`
header, per-workspace quotas) but no code path actually enforces ownership on
read, share, or relay-connect.** The code comments own this as deferred work
("enforcement comes in Wave 3 A13b", "SaaS deployments rely on workspace ACL at
the path-routing boundary") — but that enforcement is absent, so the isolation
is advisory, not real.

Decision needed before the fix phase:

- **Self-host only (`MANAGED_MODE=false`) is single-tenant and trusted** — under
  that posture rows 1–4 are the documented ADR-0010 relay-trust model working
  as intended, and the fix is to *document the boundary loudly* (and gate the
  managed-mode routes off) rather than build ACLs.
- **If managed/SaaS mode is a real shipping target**, rows 1–4 are genuine
  cross-tenant vulnerabilities and the fix is to thread workspace-ownership
  checks through `getMap`/`updateMap`/`createShareToken`/the `/yjs` upgrade and
  scope `GET /api/workspaces`. That's real feature work, not a one-line patch.

## Running log

- Sweep phase: read all of `storage/src` routes + middleware + index + billing,
  all of `realtime/src`, `infra/caddy/Caddyfile`, `infra/docker-compose.yml`,
  and ran a `git log -p` secret scan across all history. 9 findings, 5 clean
  areas. Ledger complete; holding at the sweep→fix boundary for the triage call.
